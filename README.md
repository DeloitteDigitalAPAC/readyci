# ReadyCI
A no-fuss CI/CD service and collection of build scripts

## Why use ReadyCI?

### :+1: It comes with scripts
ReadyCI comes with build scripts so that you spend less time setting up your automated CI/CD infrastructure, and get to making automated builds faster. ReadyCI scripts currently support:
* iOS apps
* Maven projects


### :+1: Command-line or web-service
You can run ReadyCI on the command-line within another CI environment like Jenkins, or run ReadyCI as a service on it's own and accept web-hook calls from GIT services.

### :+1: Supports GIT web-hooks
ReadyCI supports GIT commit web-hooks when you run it as a service so that your automated builds start as soon as you push to your git repository. ReadyCI supports web-hooks from:
* GitHub
* BitBucket

### :+1: Parses iOS provisioning profiles
Configuring iOS builds is tricky. ReadyCI uses the .mobileprovision file generated by Apple Developer Portal to automatically configure your build and remove some of the guess-work behind making your iOS app build successful.

### :+1: Handles whitespace
Paths, filenames and target names look great when you use whitespace. However, whitespace can be a nightmare to manage in CI scripts so ReadyCI handles whitespace like a pro* so that your builds keep working while your project files are clean and readable.

\* The `pipeline` command-line parameter doesn't handle whitespace well. A work in process :-)

## How to use ReadyCI
### Building ReadyCI
Download ReadyCI to your computer and navigate to the ReadyCI folder in your terminal.
Assuming that you have Maven installed, create a jar: target/readyci-0.3.jar using the following command:
```bash
$ mvn install
```

### Running a command-line build
Run a once off command-line build by specifying the `yml` configuration file and the `pipeline=` parameter. It's only fitting that ReadyCI be able to build itself!   
Try this out with the example found below using the configuration `readyConfigExample.yml` to run a ReadyCI build named `readyci` (as found in the yml file). 
```bash
$ java -jar target/readyci-0.3.jar readyConfigExample.yml pipeline=readyci

Loaded configuration readyConfigExample.yml with 2 pipelines
...
ReadyCI is in command-line mode
Building pipline readyci
...
FINISHED BUILD 74e404d8-6bae-41fa-8aa1-4d786c797c58 
```

A successful build will deploy `readyci.jar` to your `/tmp/` directory. You can check that it's there like this:
```bash
$ ls -la /tmp/readyci.jar 
-rw-r--r--  1 bradley  wheel  16612035 Jun 13 12:30 /tmp/readyci.jar
```


### Configure pipelines
Make your own copy of the `readyConfigExample.yml` file found in the ReadyCI folder and place it into the root of your Android/iOS project root repository. 
Edit the file to specify all of your pipelines and associated build tasks.


#### Examples
1 . If you would like ReadyCI to clone the repository for you into a folder.  

Redirect terminal to an empty folder which has the readyci yml configuration file, run the following command found below. ReadyCI will fetch the repository, load the configuration in `readyConfigExample.yml`, and execute the `readyci` pipeline. 
```bash
$ java -jar target/readyci.jar pipeline=ready-ci readyConfigExample.yml gitPath=git@github.com:dotb/readyci.git
```
  

2 . If you would like to build and upload the project without leaving a trace on your computer
Load the `readyConfigExample.yml`  configuration file and build the pipeline.  You will need to specify the gitPath in the local configuration file in order to fetch the repository.
 The repository found on git can also contain a `readyci.yml` configuration file which will be loaded before the build commences.
```
$ java -jar target/readyci.jar pipeline=readyci readyConfigExample.yml 
```
  
*** Note: ***  
If you name your yml configuration file as  `readyci.yml`, you don't need to specify the name of the yml file when running it in command line. ReadyCI will read the configuration file and execute the build pipeline you specify.
```
$ java -jar target/readyci.jar pipeline=readyci
```


### Running a build service
ReadyCI can run as a web-service and listen out for web-hook calls. Configure your GIT repository to post to http://<your address>:8080/webhook and then run ReadyCI with a `yml` configuration time and the `server` parameter.
```bash
java -jar target/readyci.jar readyConfigExample.yml server

Loaded configuration readyConfigExample.yml with 2 pipelines
...
ReadyCI is in server mode
Started ReadyCI in 3.655 seconds (JVM running for 4.612)
```

You can test your web-hook using cURL
```bash
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8080/webhook \
  -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
   "push":{
      "changes":[
         {
            "new":{
               "type":"branch",
               "name":"master",
               "target":{
                  "author":{
                     "raw":"Bradley Clayton <me@cheese.toast.com>"
                  }
               }
            }
         }
      ]
   },
   "repository":{
      "name":"readyci"
   }
}'
```

This will kick off a build of ReadyCI and you'll see output like this:
```bash
Webhook proceeding with build for pipline readyci
RUNNING BUILD c7a56eec-f303-4ad9-8de9-ffe5da68bef5 
STARTING TASK build_path_clean | Finish up by cleaning the build folder
...
STARTING TASK checkout_git |  
Cloning into '/tmp/readyci//c7a56eec-f303-4ad9-8de9-ffe5da68bef5'...
COMPLETED TASK checkout_git
STARTING TASK maven_install | Run maven install
Executing command: mvn install 
...
FINISHED BUILD c7a56eec-f303-4ad9-8de9-ffe5da68bef5 
```
Ready CI currently supports web-hook calls from GitHub and Bitbucket.

## Configuration explained
Ready CI is configured by supplying a simple YML file on the command line, and an optional configuration file in the root of your repository named readyci.yml. For example, the configuration below builds Ready CI using Maven and the code on GitHub.
```yml
  pipelines:
  - name: readyci # every pipeline needs a name 
    gitPath: git@github.com:dotb/readyci.git
    gitBranch: master
    parameters:
      deploySrcPath: target/readyci.jar
      deployDstPath: /tmp/readyci.jar

    tasks:
    - task: maven_install # Run maven install
 
    - task: deploy_copy # Copy the built binary to a deployment destination

    - task: build_path_clean
```
Lets take a look at some of these parameters 

| Parameter | Description |
| :-------- | :---------- |
| instanceName      | A name for your instance. This name is used to populate git commit messages so that you can identify automated commits. ReadyCI also uses the instanceName to avoid cyclic builds triggered by the web-hook receiving one of it's own commit notifications. 
| pipelines         | An array of as many pipeline configurations as you want |
| - name            | Each pipeline is named, and you use this name to start a command-line build |
|   gitPath         | The path to your code repository |
|   gitBranch       | Use the gitBranch parameter to specify which branch should trigger builds when web-hook requests are received | 
|   parameters      | Parameters are used to customise the build tasks |
|     deploySrcPath | In this example the deploy_copy task needs to know the source and destination paths for the `readyci.jar` file, so that it can copy it to the right place |
|   tasks:          | The array of tasks is used to configure each build step |
|   -  task         | The type of task is important, it tells ReadyCI which task should be run |

## Task types
ReadyCI includes a collection of task types that currently supports Maven and iOS builds.
